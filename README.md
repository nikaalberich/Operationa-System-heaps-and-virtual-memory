# Operationa-System-heaps-and-virtual-memory
Heaps. Working with virtual memory. 

1. Familiarize yourself with the memory organization and address space allocation of the process.
2. Analyze the task, make an algorithm for solving the problem.
3. Prepare test tasks to test the program.
4. Type the text of the program, compile, identify and eliminate compilation errors. 
5. Execute the program. Make sure that the task is implemented correctly. Analyze the results of the program.

The task consists of three parts:
1) Create a "memory map" - output information about the regions of the process address of the process address space (state, access, size).
2) Check the effect of page access attributes and the granularity of of memory allocation.
3) Create additional process heaps and use them, by overloading the new and delete operations for dynamic data structures data structures.
